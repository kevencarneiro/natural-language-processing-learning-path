# Natural Language Processing Learning Path

An on-going guide of how to learn Natural Language Processing, with some things that I learned but realized that is hard to find out there.
I'll try to make this as most objective as possible, trying to focus on concepts and explain some tools in a quikly way.

## Some of the content that I used to learn NLP

### Free content
* [Advanced NLP with spaCy](https://course.spacy.io) - Thanks to [@ines](https://github.com/ines) for giving us this excellent content

### Paid content
* Udacity Natural Language Processing Nanodegree

## IN PROGRESS: Suggestion of a zero-to-hero path

> **Basic**
### Python
**What?**
Data structures, variables, list manipulation, conditional expressions and loops

**Why?**
Python is a easy language to learn and much domain specific libraries have support to it

**How?**
TODO

### Numpy
**What?**
Array manipulation: Multidimensional arrays and mathematical operations

**Why?**
Numpy is much faster and use less memory. As you'll be using billions of array elements, this will make significant difference. [See more here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/what-are-the-advantages-of-numpy-over-regular-python-lists)

**How?**
TODO

### Pandas
**What?**
Data manipulation, specially importing from csv and databases

**Why?**
Pandas let you handle data more easily and do some stuff at column level wihtout have to iterating loops [See more here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-use-of-pandas-in-Python)

**How?**
